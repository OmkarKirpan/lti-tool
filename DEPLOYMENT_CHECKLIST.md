# 🚀 Render.com Deployment - Quick Checklist

## Before You Start

- [ ] Code is committed to a GitHub repository
- [ ] You have a Render.com account (free tier is fine for testing)
- [ ] You have access to OpenEdX admin panel

## Deployment Steps

### 1️⃣ Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy on Render

1. Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will detect `render.yaml` automatically
5. Click **"Apply"**
6. Wait for deployment (~5-10 minutes)

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment

After deployment, update these environment variables in Render dashboard:

**Required:**

- `TOOL_BASE_URL` → Your Render URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)

**Optional but Recommended:**

- `OPENEDX_BASE_URL` → Your OpenEdX instance URL
- `TOOL_NAME` → Your tool's display name

### 4️⃣ Get Your URLs

After deployment, note these URLs:

```
Your App:     https://your-app-name.onrender.com
Login URL:    https://your-app-name.onrender.com/login
Launch URL:   https://your-app-name.onrender.com/launch
JWKS URL:     https://your-app-name.onrender.com/jwks
Status Check: https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/status
```

### 5️⃣ Configure OpenEdX

1. Go to OpenEdX Admin → **LTI 1.3 Tool Configuration**
2. Create new tool with your URLs from step 4
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Deployment ID**
4. Update `configs/lti_config.json` in your repository:
   ```json
   {
     "https://your-openedx.com": {
       "client_id": "PASTE_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
       "deployment_ids": ["PASTE_DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE"]
     }
   }
   ```
5. Commit and push (will trigger auto-redeploy)

### 6️⃣ Test

1. Add LTI component in OpenEdX course
2. Launch from student view
3. You should see the launch success page! 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

- ⏰ Service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- 🐌 First request after spin-down takes ~30 seconds (cold start)
- ✅ Perfect for development/testing
- 💰 Upgrade to Starter ($7/month) for production (always on)

### Common Issues

**Build fails?**

```bash
# Ensure build.sh is executable:
chmod +x build.sh
git add build.sh
git commit -m "Make build script executable"
git push
```

**LTI launch fails?**

- ✅ Check `TOOL_BASE_URL` is correct (HTTPS)
- ✅ Verify `configs/lti_config.json` has correct credentials

**Session issues?**

- Already configured correctly for HTTPS and iframes
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`
